# no-more-dead-plants
An app used for tracking your plant watering habits.

This project is a work-in-progress demonstration of a front end app using React and Redux.

## Current features
* Allows the user to add their plants to their feed
* Displays to the user how long it has been since a given plant has been watered and lets them know in how many days they should water it again
* Allows a user to input when they have watered a plant

## Future features
* The ability to edit plant information
* The ability to delete a plant (rip)
* Form validation for adding and editing plants


## Possibilities for added scope & functionality
* The ability for a user to "put off" a watering if the plant soil is not ready for watering
* The ability for a user to rate or indicate plant health with every watering
* The ability for a user to track plant well-being along side previous watering frequencies, and to be able to download this data for their own purposes
